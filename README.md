## Hey Nerds 👋

<!--
**sandipan1/sandipan1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



I work on AI systems and data infrastructure. My focus right now is building reliable LLM applications with good retrieval, evaluation loops, and production patterns.

## Current Work
- Building RAG systems with production observability
- Experimenting with evaluation frameworks for agentic workflows
- Exploring MCP + HICA for tool-based systems

## What I'm Sharing Here
- Small reproducible experiments
- Patterns and architectural notes
- Real examples of working code

## Selected Repos
- rag-cookbook: Practical retrieval patterns with metrics
- llm-evals: Configurable evaluation harness for production LLM workflows
- mcp-agent-demo: Minimal agent using MCP with real tools
